      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented programming organizes programs into objects with data and behavior, making them easier to understand, maintain, and reuse. It also supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which help manage complexity in larger systems.</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>AccountType provides a central set of constants for account types, ensuring consistency, preventing typos, and making code easier to read and maintain.</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation hides the internal details of a class to protect data integrity and reduce complexity. Public members expose functionality safely, while private members keep internal state hidden and secure.</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>Using new creates a new object, sets up its internal structure, runs the constructor, and returns the instance. Each instance has its own properties but shares methods from the class blueprint.</p>
